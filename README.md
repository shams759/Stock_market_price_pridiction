In this project we attempt to implement machine learning approach to predict 
stock prices. Machine learning is effectively implemented in forecasting stock 
prices. The objective is to predict the stock prices in order to make more informed 
and accurate investment decisions. We propose a stock price prediction system 
that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning, and other external 
factors for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction accuracy and issuing 
profitable trades.
There are two types of stocks. You may know of intraday trading by the 
commonly used term "day trading." Intraday traders hold securities positions 
from at least one day to the next and often for several days to weeks or months. 
LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able 
to store past information. This is important in our case because the previous price 
of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price. While predicting the actual price 
of a stock is an uphill climb, we can build a model that will predict whether the 
price will go up or down.
This article introduces the theoretical knowledge of time series model and LSTM 
neural network, and select real stocks in the stock market, perform modeling 
analysis and predict stock prices, and then use the root mean square error to 
compare the prediction results of several models.
The time series for stock prices belong to non-stationary and non-linear data, 
making the prediction of future price trends extremely challenging. In order to 
learn the long-term dependence of stock prices, deep learning methods such as 
the LSTM method are used to obtain longer data dependence and overall change
